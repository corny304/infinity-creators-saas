# Note: Manus Platform uses its own deployment system
# This workflow validates that the code is ready to deploy
# Actual deployment happens through the Manus Management UI:
# 1. Create a checkpoint (webdev_save_checkpoint)
# 2. Click "Publish" button in Management UI
# 3. Manus handles zero-config deployment with automatic SSL, CDN, and custom domains
